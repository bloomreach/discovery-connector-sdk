  <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
  <p>
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
    since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
    scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five
    centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
    essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
    of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
    of Lorem Ipsum.

  <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
  <p>
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the
    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of
    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
    letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it
    look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web
    page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a
    search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their
    infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
  </p>

  <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
  <p>
    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It
    has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it
    over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
    Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through
    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
    undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33
    of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
    Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of
    ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
    Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section
    1.10.32.
  </p>

  <p>
    The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced
    below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de
    Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
    original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation
    by H. Rackham.
  </p>

  <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
  <p>
    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the
    majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or
    randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
    going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
    anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum
    generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
    necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses
    a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model
    sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
    generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected
    humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
